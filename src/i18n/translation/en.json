With a main focus on Front-end, I'm having daily contact with html, css and Javascript in online courses and personal projects where I practice the concepts learned. Despite the focus on the Front-end, curiosity and advice from friends who were already programmers, led me to also study the Back-end, taking full advantage of the versatility of Javascript, making me aspire to be a Full-stack professional in the future"
